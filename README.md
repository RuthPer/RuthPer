- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a real-time Qubit Detection system using YOLO (You Only Look Once) and OpenCV to process live video input from a webcam. My goal is to accurately detect and analyze qubit states for potential quantum computing simulations and visualizations.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to train and fine-tune YOLOv8 models for object detection, especially in the context of qubit recognition and real-time computer vision, as well as improving my full-stack web development skills by working with APIs, databases, and frontend design.
- ðŸ‘¯ I'm looking to collaborate on research projects that intersect technology and social impact, especially in games, climate science, and equity-driven tech initiatives.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with real-time object detection optimization and learning best practices for deploying AI models with limited datasets.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about modding games with Lua to challenge colonialist narratives, YOLO-based qubit detection and quantum computing applications, creative CS projects in college, or my internship experiences at Fermilab and Brookhaven National Laboratory.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: She/ Her
- âš¡ Fun fact: I once redesigned an entire in-game economy to make virtual villagers more self-sufficient and challenge colonialist systemsâ€”using code!
